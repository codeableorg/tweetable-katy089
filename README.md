# Tweetable-App

 This app was made in rails (Front-end and Back-end).However, if you want to consume data, you can go to the branch api/devise_token. There's a insomnia's file where can see the EndPoints.

## Installation

For this project I used [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage gems.

#### 1. Install all the project's gems
```bash
bundle install
```
#### 2. Create the database and setup
```bash
rails db:reset
```
#### 3. Raise the server.That's all
```bash
